# Web Components & Lit Library - a Curated List of documentation

A curated list of great documentation to get frontenders started with **Web Components & Lit**, with or without a framework.

# Web Components basics

Basically, Web Components consist of [three technologies](https://exyte.com/blog/web-components-technology "Overview of the Web components in 2021"): Custom elements, Shadow DOM, and HTML templates.- [Web Components | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components "Web Components | MDN")\

# Google's Lit Library

> A really high level view of Lit would be that it's simply filling in the Gaps in the standards.

Lit is a tiny (\<5Kb) library written by **Justin Fagnani** of Google, which was developed to fill a few gaps and make working with Web Components as easy as working with **React UI**, but without the need for expensive indirections like Virtual DOM and JSX.[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndZ8vcxNp0Q)> *A Lit component renders its template initially when it's added to the DOM on a page. After the initial render, any change to the component's reactive properties triggers an update cycle, re-rendering the component.*

> *Lit batches updates to maximize performance and efficiency. Setting multiple properties at once triggers only one update, performed asynchronously at microtask timing.*
> *During an update, only the parts of the DOM that change are re-rendered. Although Lit templates look like string interpolation, Lit parses and creates static HTML once, and then only updates changed values in expressions after that, making updates very efficient. - from* [*https://lit.dev/docs/components/rendering*](https://lit.dev/docs/components/rendering "Rendering ‚Äì Lit")

# Web Components Only Approach (not using a framework)

When you decide not to use any existing framework, you have to decide what to use for a few common areas normally taken care of by the framework, such as state management and routing.

- [Project Fugu](https://www.chromium.org/teams/web-capabilities-fugu/ "Web Capabilities (Project Fugu üê°)")
 
## State Management

State Management is one of the strongest reasons people keep referring to frameworks, but if you look at what people then use, it's a lot of Redux and other libraries, which are combined with their favorite frameworks, sometimes even packaged, but libraries they are.The same libraries and approaches can be combined with Web Components and Lit!- [Using Redux in a LitElement app | Vaadin](https://vaadin.com/blog/using-redux-in-a-litelement-app "Using Redux in a LitElement app | Vaadin")

## Routing

When not using a framework, routing is not provided as a ready-to-use component. Using browser-native functionality isn't complex (using [History](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API/Working_with_the_History_API "Working with the History API - Web APIs | MDN")), and lately, the new URLPattern API allows you to do any kind of routing, including complex parameter passing, natively. The Lit PWA (see my [previously mentioned article](<https://The Browser is your Framework: Building a PWA with only Web Components and Lit>)) uses it, including lazy-loading polyfills if needed.- [URLPattern brings routing to the web platform - Chrome Developers](https://developer.chrome.com/articles/urlpattern/ "URLPattern brings routing to the web platform - Chrome Developers")Other router solutions:- [Polymer/pwa-helpers: Small helper methods or mixins to help you build web apps.

# Using Web Components in Frameworks

When you do decide to work with your favorite framework, Web Components can still be a valid choice for everything UI, because you will be able to reuse the components across projects with differing frameworks, and they will work regardless of framework upgrades or switching to other frameworks. This is why many companies, such as Google, Adobe, RedHat, Microsoft, Cisco, SAP and VMWare are already investing heavily in Web Components.
